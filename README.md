# EG 

## Description
This repository contains eg or "for example" files. That includes this README.

These files are used as development settings, service files, vim buffers, and or reference materials. The directory is mapped to my xdg-user-default Templates. This allows me to create instances with a drop down and click.

The file names aren't changed unless their are multiple instances. In that case, they should be prefixed with identifiers or given a .default extension.
